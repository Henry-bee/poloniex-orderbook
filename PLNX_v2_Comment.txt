1) is mapping consistent every day? would it be better to run it from __init__ under the PoloniexPush? (resolved)
2) is float not enough so you need to use float32? (resolved)
3) is it necessary to sleep for 20 secs on init? 

Henry: (REDUCED TO 10, NEED TIME FOR INITIAL HANDSHAKE) 

4)
ln:105 ->
if np.isclose( float(tick[-1]), 0):
	return


Henry: Not sure? It runs fine

5)	
not sure if you have separated the case for orderBookModify (newly added) and removal
https://poloniex.com/support/api/
[{data: {rate: '0.00300888', type: 'bid', amount: '3.32349029'},type: 'orderBookModify'}]
[{data: {rate: '0.00311164', type: 'ask' },type: 'orderBookRemove'}]

Henry: Both are separated

6) can you separate the code for JSON like the pusherclientb/channel.py and pusherclientb/connection.py such that we can have cleaner code for changes

Henry:Split into connection.py and poloniex.py

7) please do not change the function under book.py, instead, you can use them to update the book by passing the necessary information. the Book class is used every where in our application and it cannot be changed like this way.

Henry: Noted

8) please log the Book attributes instead, yoy may use Book().printBook() or __repr__ is also fine by me, as long as the logging pattern is the same.

Henry: Noted
